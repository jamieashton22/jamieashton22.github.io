            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>The aim of this project is to create a 'mini RTOS' for STM32 from scratch without using any hardware-abstraction.
                Essentially I am aiming to create a pre-emptive kernel including features like context-switching, task scheduling 
                and possibly semaphores This will be written for and demonstrated on the STM32 Nucleo-F401RE. I am hoping that this will
                give me good knowledge in embedded C, the STM32 microcontroller family and the Arm architecture.
            </p>

            <p> I am expecting this project to take a long time, as I have to prioritise university coursework, exams, 
                and my individual third-year project. As such I will use this page to list any milestones/steps I complete.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Configured interrupts with the SysTick timer and used it to blink an LED.</li>
                <li>Used the SysTick timer to create a general timebase (1ms).</li>
                <li>Created a blocking delay function using this timebase.</li>
                <li> Implemented non-blocking delays using this timebase by polling.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Objectives</h2>
            <p>
                Low-cost sensors like the HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor are accessible and easy to use, 
                but often their raw readings are prone to noise and spikes/outliers. 
                Taking raw, unfiltered signals from these devices can have negative consequences 
                when used in larger systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                The purpose of this project was to improve the accuracy of an HC-SR04 ultrasonic 
                sensor by using common real-time digital filtering techniques. These were a 
                simple moving average (SMA), exponential moving average (EMA), and median filter.

            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <p>
                The hardware used was minimal, just an HC-SR04 ultrasound sensor and an Arduino Nano. 
                Separate classes were created for each filter. These classes are modular, and the intention 
                is for me to be able to reuse them in future projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                To show the filters in action, I created a Python script to plot the filtered and unfiltered 
                data in real time and to calculate metrics such as SNR and standard deviation. An object was 
                placed at a set distance, and the raw unfiltered signal was analysed. Then I added each of 
                the filters in turn.

            <h2>Filters</h2>

            <h3>Simple Moving Average (SMA)</h3>
            <p>
                This filter smooths data by averaging a set number of previous measurements within a defined 
                window size. This helps with noise reduction and is simple to implement. However, large 
                window sizes can introduce significant delay to the signal.
            </p>

            <h3>Exponential Moving Average (EMA)</h3>
            <p>
                This filter smooths data by applying a weighted average where recent measurements are given 
                more weighting than older ones. This weighting is controlled by a smoothing parameter alpha. 
                Small alpha produces stronger smoothing but more lag, large alpha means less smoothing but 
                less lag.
            </p>

            <h3>Median Filter</h3>
            <p>
                This filter smooths data by sorting a window of n recent measurements and taking the median 
                value as the output. It is highly effective at rejecting outliers and impulsive noise while 
                preserving sharp changes in the signal, but large window sizes (n) can cause delay in the response.
